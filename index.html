   <h1><b>What is HTML?</b></h1>
   HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), is the languange the browsers can understand and show us somethng we won't.
   This text for example, was wrote with this languange, where you can just type something or put images, buttons, and personalize them.
   
   <h3>How does it work?</h3>
   HTML works with <b>Tags</b> and <b>Elements</b>. For example.<br>
   I can make a word becomes <i>Italic</i>, by using a tag the letter i inside < and >. the element inside these Symbols define the tag, and these tags make the page look like what we want. If i want to jump line in HTML, i cannot just press enter, i need to put a tag that allows the text be be shown in next line.<br><br>
   And everything follows the same concepts.
